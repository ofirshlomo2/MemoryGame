Memory Card Game
Classic memory card game with eight pairs to match. All cards have a spring theme.

How it works
Click on two cards, when they match they will stay visible. Otherwise they will turn around and you can try again. The game is over when all pairs are found. 

Instructions
Choose your level - Easy, Medium,  or ninja .

Each level has a few different themes to choose from, dark or light mode

Now, click on a card to turn it over, and then try to find the matching card! (You can only have two cards flipped over at once!)

If you get it right, the matched cards will stay face-up.

If you get it wrong, they will turn back over so you can select them again.

Try to find all the pairs in the deck in as little moves as possible!

A timer will start when you click on "start game".

If you would like to restart your game at any game, simply press the restart button at the top.
